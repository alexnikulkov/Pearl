The branch `gh-pages` stores the web site appearing at `[https://facebookresearch.github.io/Pearl/](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Pearl/)`. Currently, this automatically redirects to Pearl's official web site `[https://pearlagent.github.io/](https://pearlagent.github.io/)`.

The site has been initially created to host a directory `data` hosting data files for testing and demoing Pearl. It's a convenient location accessible everywhere, and meant to be administered by the same team managing Pearl source code.
