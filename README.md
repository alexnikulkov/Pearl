The branch `gh-pages` stores the web site appearing at [https://facebookresearch.github.io/Pearl/](https://facebookresearch.github.io/Pearl/). Currently, this automatically redirects to Pearl's official web site [https://pearlagent.github.io/](https://pearlagent.github.io/).

The site has been initially created to host a directory `data` hosting data files for testing and demoing Pearl. It's a convenient location accessible everywhere, and meant to be managed by the same team responsible for Pearl's source code.

If you upload a file `mydata.txt` to the subdirectory `data`, it will be available at `https://facebookresearch.github.io/Pearl/data/mydata.txt`.

File sizes are limited to 100 MiB. You can upload smaller files (up to 25 MiB) directly in the browser.
